This assignment is to write a multithread Java program that
performs matrix multiplication. In your program there should be two operand
matrices and a results matrix. The two operand matrices should be populated with
sample data. You will need to calculate each element in the result matrix using a
separate thread. The sizes of three matrices should be stored in static variables. The
contents of the two operand matrices and the result matrix should be printed by
your program.
